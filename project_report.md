### **Team Formation**

* Paola Gonzalez Melendez \- FullStack  
* Tommy Hernandez Arroyo \- FullStack

### **Collaboration Strategies**

* Communication Channels: Discord, WhatsApp  
* Tools Used: Google Docs

### **Ideas Explored**

* Idea 1 \- **Portfolio maker**  
  * Description:

  We had the vision clear and even the structure. We talked about including templates and even implementing suggestions to the user so their portfolio could be as optimal as possible. 

  * Rejection:

  The reasons as to why we scratched the idea were rather simple; we got bored and although it did resonate with us. We decided it was best to move on from this. 

* Idea 2 \- **Travel App**  
  * Description:

  The travel app was also a closer runner up. We thought about how messy it is to travel without a plan. Sometimes we spent more time thinking about the potential plans we have rather than actually executing them and so we thought *“How about a travel app?”* We talked about placing the plane ticket on the app along with the hotel reservations and the app would help you find places such as food, entertainment, or stores nearby. It would also include the schedules of the hotel and if it had events during your stay.

  * Rejection:

  The reason we decided to move on from this idea was the time frame and we weren't sure about this idea to our full extent.

* Idea 3 \- **Clasificados Updated**  
  * Description:

  The app was going to be an updated and more modern version of the current and existing Clasificados Online website. We talked about combining the pinterest facade, the boards would show the houses listed for sale or another other selling or renting option.

  * Rejection:

  Due to the time frame we are unable to complete this project.

* Idea 4 \- **Finance Tracker**  
  * Description:

  We talked about our problems with the tracking of our expenses and decided a finance tracker could help solve this issue. This app would allow users to log transactions, categorize their expenses and visualize their spending patterns. 

  * Approval:

  We chose this as our MVP because feasible, it directly solves a relatable problem and it can be implemented within the project timeline. 

* Idea 6 \- **Cooking App**  
  * Description:

  We talked about an app where users could look up recipes, plan their meals, and possibly generate shopping lists based on their selected recipe.

  * Rejection: Although it was useful and even fun to think about, this idea was too broad and given the timeframe it would require extensive recipe data and more.

### **Selected MVP Concept**

* Name: **Finance App**  
* Description:

  Let the users create and login to an account to track their spendings in a visual user-friendly interface design that is simple and customizable. Users can view their spending patterns, and gain insights to better manage their finances.

* Reason for Selection:  
  * Innovation: It stands out by emphasizing simplicity, customization, and a clean, modern interface.  
  * Alignment: The idea aligns with both of our interests in building a user focused application. It also aligns with the technical skills we have that can make it possible. While also heading into a professional software engineering project.

**Overview:**

After exploring each and every single one of our options we opted to move forward with the Finance App as our Minimum Viable Product.  We picked this idea because it's practical, aligned with both of our interests, and it’s achievable within the timeframe of the project. Unlike some of our earlier ideas, which were either too big or complex, this one feels just right.
